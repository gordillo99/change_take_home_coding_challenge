Change.org Take-Home Coding Exercise
=================================

This is a take-home coding exercise used to help evaluate and work
with candidates looking to join the team at Change.org. The general idea
is for candidates to complete the challenge before the
engineering interview. During the interview we will use the code as a
discussion point.


### What we are looking for?

You can submit the code by providing a pointer to a source control repository. In your submission, you should include:

 - The code (include all relevant files).

 - A small __README__ documenting any assumptions or simplifications you have made, and a link to the __working website__.

F.A.Q.
------

1. Is it OK to share your solutions publicly?

 - You do the work, you own the code. Given we are asking you to give up your
   time, it is entirely reasonable for you to keep and use your solution as you
   see fit.

2. Should I do X?

 - For any value of `X`, it is up to you, we intentionally leave the problems a
   little open-ended and will leave it up to you to provide us with what you
   see as important. Just remember the rough time-frame of the project, if it
   is going to take you a couple of days, it isn't essential.

3. Something is ambiguous, and I don't know what to do?

 The first thing is: don't get stuck. We really don't want to trip you
 up unintentionally, we are just attempting to see how you approach
 problems. That said, there are intentional ambiguities in the
 specification, partly to see how you fill in those gaps, and partly
 because the specification is written in English.

 If you really feel stuck, our first preference is for you to make a
 decision and document it with your submission - in this case there is
 really no wrong answer. If you feel it is not possible to do this,
 just send us an email and we will try to clarify or correct the
 question for you.
