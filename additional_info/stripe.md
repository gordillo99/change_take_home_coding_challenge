Stripe
======

[Stripe](https://stripe.com) is a payment processor with software that allows individuals and businesses to make and receive payments over the Internet. Stripe provides the technical, fraud prevention, and banking infrastructure required to operate online payment systems.

### Getting Started
Stripe provides plenty of documentation to help you get started. There are two main products that you can use to complete this assignment.

1. Stripe Checkout

   Stripe Checkout is one way to process payments. This product is easy to setup. It uses a 2 step process in which a token is created in order to charge a customer.

   [Documentation and Example](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/elements/quickstart)

2. Stripe Elements

   Stripe Elements is a more advanced product that lets you have more control over the payment processing UI. Stripe Elements also comes with some cool features like credit card live validation and the option to add a [Payment Request Button](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button).

   [Documentation and Example](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js#elements)

   **Note:** If you intend to use Stripe Elements with React, take a look at [react-stripe-elements](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-elements).
